    "We'll be working through a few code demos over the semester. Many useful interpretability libraries are written in python, so we'll need to get familiar with installing packages and running notebooks in this language. Unlike R, python package management tries to maintain backward compatability (older versions of packages are supposed to be supported). This creates a bit more complexity in installation, though, because different projects might need different versions of the same package. Trying to keep them all in the same python installation can lead to package requirement conflicts. For this reason, it's common to use \"environments\" to separate different installations, each which has its own set of packages installed.\n",

    "We'll be using `conda` to manage packages. You can install `conda` using the `Quick command line install` steps at [this link](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install). Once you run this, you should see `(base)` appear at the start of your terminal prompts. This means that you are in the \"base\" conda environment, which people usually leave clear of any extra python packages."
